In this page, I want to create a mini to do list.

What I need to?
A to do list have an id, text, user id, status(complete, pending, canceled)
For the structure it need a textfield, a label for id, a combobox for the status and a button for delete 
  1 'This is an example' Status: 'Completed'(combobox). [delete]

For create a new task, I need a label, a text field and two buttons.
Introduce a task |'example: I wash the dishes'| [create][delete]

What happen when...?

button [create] => then create a new structure in the page "X 'This is an example' Status: 'Completed'(combobox). [delete]"
Introduce button [delete] => delete the text in the main textfield

task button [delete] => delete this structure
